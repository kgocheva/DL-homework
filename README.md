# DL-homework

This is my course assignment in Deep Learning as finishing the course orgaised by SoftUni, Bulgaria in November/December 2018 (https://softuni.bg/trainings/1921/deep-learning-november-2018). I was lucky to hear the exceptional Yordan Darakchiev - a teacher after my heart who  gets the questions on the fly and gives insightful answers filled with heuristics and heaps of new knowledge. 
We had an interactive walktrough on basics (gradien descent, dropout, regularisation, simple estimators, training and optimisation techniques), followed by overview of the main principles, key architectures and important new papers on image processing, NLP, generative models and reinforcement learning. In fact, the last developments we covered were sometimes published less than a week ago!
The key deliverable is the course assignent where a lot of freedom was given to the participants. I chose to work on the beginning of a partial solution for my PhD thesis in ecology. This repository contains the assignment but may, over time, be extended with new contents as my PhD progresses.
